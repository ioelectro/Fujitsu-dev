# Integrated software development environment for Fujitsu microcontrollers

Fujitsu offers a full range of software tools, including ANSI C compiler with highly optimized code, macroassembler, simulator, etc. To facilitate work, these products are combined into a single complex called "Softune", which allows you to produce automatic compilation, contains ample debugging capabilities and built-in help system.

The basic set of software for microcontrollers F 2 MC-8L/16L/16LX includes the following functions:

- Simple menu system with "mouse" management
- Support for collaboration on a multi-user project
- Automatic start of the editor, compiler, assembler, and debugger
- Moving to Error by Simply Pressing a Mouse
- Using a built-in editor with spelling check, or external editor
- Built-in guide to the compiler and assembler
- Configuring the user's working environment
- Preservation/rest recovery of the working environment 

Possibilities of the debugger:

- Debugging in source texts (C, Assembler or mixed)
- Navigation Features: Go, Go to line, Step out, Step over, Call function, Reset
- Browsing Variables: Automatic Update (x Sec), formatting (Hex, Bin, etc.), structures
- View Global and Local Variables
- Memory Window : Formatting, Symbolic Debugging, Code Debugging, ASCII
- Disassembler Window
- Simulator : debugging of I/O operations with data storage, interrupt simulation
- Service functions: log files and command files. 

For debugging, the system uses a real-time emulator and support board for various microcontroller families, including for debugging systems using the CAN protocol. For different types of microcontroller housings, emulator adapter modules and special cables are available. The emulator connects to the serial port of a personal computer running Windows 95/98 or NT.

Possibilities of emulator:

- Support for low-energy microcontrollers
- Debugging in real time
- Multi-level event controller
- Viewing the contents of memory "on the fly"
- Additional cables for connection in the debuggable system
